                    <h2 class="subtitle">The Adventure Begins!</h2>
                    <p class="story">When a terrible curse befell the dwarven Kingdom of Isiliath, a cleric by the name
                        of Fargrim vowed to find the source of Isiliath's blight and destroy it. As the dwarf journeyed
                        south on his quest he encountered a halfling by the name of Johnboy Tealeaf,
                        who had lost the trail of a hobgoblin host that had captured his eldest brother, Fredman. After
                        having his life saved by Fargrim, Johnboy agreed to join the dwarf on his quest with the hopes
                        of finding some clue of his brother along the way. When the two arrived at the
                        Cydonian town of Northwatch in the foothills of the mighty Dwarrowhelm Range, they decided to
                        rest their legs at the Frozen Wench Tavern and listen to bardic songs of a half-elf named Labius
                        Minoris. Labius, a wandering scoundrel, had been chased out of so many towns in
                        the Lords' Alliance by many an angry father that he had finally landed at the edge of the known
                        world, busking for change. Yet, on the very day Fargrim and Johnboy arrived at his latest venue,
                        Labius received a visit from an old and unexpected friend: the Gnome Ranger. A
                        forest gnome by the name of Orryn Reese, the Gnome Ranger wandered the world as a bounty hunter,
                        searching for purpose after he had avenged the death of his wife. As his travels brought him
                        west, the Gnome Ranger eventually came into the service of the Yuan-Ti Empire, controlled
                        by the recently-crowned and mysterious Empress Valac as well as her trusted confidantes,
                        Angrboda and Apophis. The satrap of the conquered Kingdom of Myraxia, Apophis hired the Gnome
                        Ranger to hunt down the traitor dragonborn Xythlaxxx Braxxtongue and bring him to justice. By
                        leaving
                        the infamous acadmeny known as the Schlomance, Xythlaxxx had broken his oath in his training to
                        become a Solomonar, one of the legendary, dragon-riding storm wizards of the Yuan-Ti city of
                        Goetia. The Gnome Ranger, a peerless hunter, found the oathbreaker soon enough, but, upon
                        hearing of the wickedness Xythlaxxx had endured at the hands of the empire, he decided to help
                        the dragonborn slave escape to freedom. When the two outlaws arrived at the port city of Kyprus,
                        they wasted no time in finding a vessel to take them to Cydon City the other side of the world,
                        far from the furious satrap's soldiers that hunted them relentlessly. It was on this voyage that
                        Xythlaxxx and the Gnome Ranger met their fellow stowaway, an aarakocra monk by the name of Zeed.
                        Having been exiled from the Plane of Air for the murder of his brother, the disgraced monk
                        longed to journey far from where he'd been cast out to and see the world. Eventually, upon
                        arriving in Cydon City, the Gnome Ranger heard rumors of a certain half-elf playing in a tavern
                        a few days journey north. And so, with his new friends Xythlaxxx and Zeed, the Gnome Ranger met
                        his
                        old friend Labius at the Frozen Wench Tavern. The meeting, however, was short-lived as the
                        ignorant and drunken local guards did not take kindly to the foreign-looking ruffian at the bar.
                        As insults gave way to fisticuffs and fisticuffs gave way to Zeed
                        killing a man with a stool, the adventurers rushed to the protect the innocent men from the
                        intolerant guards. With many of the guards dead and many more on the way, the ruffians, who were
                        bandits in the notorious Vanderleaf Gang, introduced themselves
                        as Uthred Morgrym and Len Ni and urged the adventurers to escape across the nearby border with
                        them. With the Knights of Cydonia hot on their tail, the adventurers joined the Vanderleaf gang
                        in their western flight into the Lords' Alliance, where Fargrim, Johnboy, Labius, Orryn,
                        Xythlaxxx, and Zeed would no doubt find their destinies...</p>

                                    Labius now sees an opportunity to complete his master's quest by speaking with the
                                    lich-king Vecna in the hopes of assembling a dark army.
                                    Yet, with a missing eye and a shattered mind, the task seems easier sung than
